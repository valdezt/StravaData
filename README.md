# StravaData
Some code I'm working on to analyze my own biking data using the Strava app.

Files obtained from a personal account at strava.com are in .gpx format. The bikedata.py
code has tools to help extract the data from the .gpx xml-type file using BeautifulSoup4.
More on this to come as I work on my blog post about this data at tvdatascience.wordpress.com.
